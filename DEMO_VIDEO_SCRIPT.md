## 📝 Video Script

---

### **[0:00 - 0:30] Opening & Hook**

**[Screen: AION Logo Animation]**

**Narrator**:
> "What if your crypto could optimize itself? Welcome to AION Vault - where artificial intelligence meets decentralized finance on Somnia blockchain."

**[Text on screen]**:
- AION: Autonomous Intelligence Optimizing Networks
- Built for Somnia AI Hackathon 2024

---

### **[0:30 - 1:15] The Problem**

**[Screen: Split screen showing manual yield farming vs AION]**

**Narrator**:
> "Traditional DeFi yield farming has problems:
> 
> ❌ Manual monitoring 24/7
> ❌ Missing optimal opportunities  
> ❌ Complex risk assessment
> ❌ High gas fees from frequent moves"

**[Show graph of volatile yields]**

> "Users need to constantly watch markets, compare protocols, assess risks, and manually rebalance. It's exhausting and expensive."

---

### **[1:15 - 2:00] The Solution**

**[Screen: AION Architecture Diagram]**

**Narrator**:
> "AION Vault solves this with autonomous AI agents running on Somnia blockchain.
>
> Our AI agent:
> ✅ Analyzes REAL on-chain data 24/7
> ✅ Compares APY across protocols  
> ✅ Calculates risk-adjusted returns
> ✅ Rebalances autonomously when profitable"

**[Highlight each component]**:
- AION Vault (user funds)
- AI Agent (decision maker)
- Strategy Adapters (Venus, PancakeSwap, Aave)

> "Everything runs transparently on-chain. No black boxes, no centralized control."
